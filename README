Sort-Radix version 0.01
=======================

 This is an implementation based on Jarkko's Wolf boook (Mastering Algorithms with Perl, pp. 145-147)

 By definition: radix sort is a multiple pass distribution sort algorithm that distributes each item to a bucket according to part of
 the item's key beginning with the least significant part of the key. After each pass, items are collected from the buckets,
 keeping the items in order, then redistributed according to the next most significant part of the key. 

 Radix sort is nice as it take N * M passes, where N is the length of the keys. It is very useful for sorting large volumes of keys of
 the same length, such as postal codes.
